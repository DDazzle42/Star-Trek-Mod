Have you ever wanted Star Trek in your endless sky game? Already have the Final Frontier mod, but feeling like it's not enough?
Well introducing The not so final Final Frontier! We got Borg, we got warp 10 excitement, we got uhhhh, Romulans? We got lots of it!
We even have a custom start! Just don't ask about the story line, okay? We got wormholes everywhere! We even got custom music for several systems!
So, boldly go into the final frontier!
