	description "The Xindi-Aquatic cruiser was a type of starship used by the Xindi-Aquatics during the 22nd century. The vessel was at least 1,800 meters long, heavily armed, and equipped with the most advanced technology of any of the five Xindi species. The ship featured a hydrodynamic, swept-wing hull structure and a large hangar bay in the primary section that could be used to carry other starships."
