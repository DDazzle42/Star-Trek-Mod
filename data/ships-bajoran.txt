	description "Bajoran interceptors or Bajoran patrol ships, were a type of impulse ship often utilized as interceptors by the Bajoran Militia, that were lightly armed with two phaser emitters. The vessels also had towing facilities. It was generally believed by Commander Benjamin Sisko that a Starfleet runabout could handle a Bajoran patrol."
