	description "The Ambassador-Class Exploratory/Heavy Cruiser was designed to be a replacement for the outdated fleet of Excelsior-Class and Constellation-Class vessels, and to create a true front-line heavy cruiser between 2325 and 2360. The Ambassador-Class cruisers were the primary capital ships of starfleet until 2372, when starfleet stopped production of these ships in favor of the larger, more resilient Galaxy-Class starships."
