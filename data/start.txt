	`The main corridor is the main place for shopping, filled with dozens of humans and aliens, you reconize the Narn, the Centauri, the Minbari and there are even more that you have never heard of.`
	`	Your office is equally impressive. Large computer monitors fill the walls, with stock quotes and other information spilling down them almost too fast to read. You occasionally glimpse the names of places that you have only seen in movies: Proxima 3. Centauri Prime. Earth.`
	`	Captn Sheridan showed you to your quarters. It is not large, but quite cozy. You can see the babcom unit on the wall flashing, appears damaged. "It's quite a suprise that Earth Dome assigned you as Head of Merchants here so shortly after the beginning of shadow war. We are still cleaning things up, this is the best we can do for now. Now settle in, we will meet the ambassadors in 1 hour." you put down your belongings and wonder what is the Shadow war. `
	`	Arriving at the meeting room, you see dozens of ambassadors from the League of Non-aligned Worlds. Captn Sheridan introduces you to ambassador G'kar of Narn, Londo Mollari of Centauri and Delenn of Minbari. Ambassador Delenn stands up and bows politely, "Welcome to babylon 5!" she smiles, and The other ambassadors greets you each in their own fasions. "well, you must have a name, yes?" asks ambassador Mollari with a big smile on his face. You try your best to not laugh at his hair style and replies:  `
	`	I am `
	name
	`	The elevator is so well-tuned that you do not even realize it is moving until it has deposited you at blue 2. But as you leave the elevator, you are smiling. This crazy adventure suddenly feels real to you. You are going to do it. You are finally going to start a new life at Babylon 5.`
	`	"There is your new ship," says Security officer Zack, "you just need to pay for the material price and she is yours. what a beauty, isn't she?" The Whitestar medium warship is available for immediate purchase, what you do will determine your future...`
