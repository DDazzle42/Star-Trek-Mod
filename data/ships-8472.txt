	description "The Species 8472 bio-ship was a type of organic-based vessel used by Species 8472 in large numbers during their invasion of the Milky Way Galaxy in 2373. In 2373, the Borg provoked a war with Species 8472 by invading fluidic space. Species 8472 defeated the Borg and launched their own counter-invasion of the Milky Way, sending hundreds of bio-ships through a string of quantum singularities in a region of space later nicknamed the 'Northwest Passage'."
