	landscape land/babylon5
	music ambient/babylon5
	description `	Deep Space 9, unofficially known as DS9, and originally known as Terok Nor, was one of the most historically, politically, and strategically important space stations in the Alpha Quadrant during the latter half of the 24th century. The space station was constructed by Bajoran slave labor overseen by the Cardassians in orbit of Bajor during their occupation of the planet. Under Federation administration following the Cardassian withdrawal, the station was relocated into the Bajoran system's Denorios belt. There, DS9 became a vital commercial port and defensive outpost due to its location near the mouth of the Bajoran wormhole. It later became a key strategic location during the Dominion War for both the Dominion and the Federation Alliance. `

planet "New Austria"
	attributes "dirt belt" mining
	landscape land/valley9
	description `New Austria is a rugged mountain world, full of snow-capped peaks and valleys so deep and so steep that they rarely see sunlight.`
	description `	The few settlements that have been built here were developed for mining sapphires and rubies. The sapphires found in New Austria range from blue to yellow to black to clear in color, and are used both for industrial abrasives and for jewelry.`
	description `	For centuries the locals have been trying to find a deposit of diamonds, which would sell for much higher prices than sapphires, and local folklore revolves around the prosperity that would come to this world if diamonds were ever discovered.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is nothing but a couple of landing pads on the outskirts of one of the larger mining villages, high up on a mountain ridge to allow easy access for starships. A few roads lead down from there to the village, where you can trade for local goods or get food from the miners' cafeteria.`
	spaceport `	By the time you have walked to the center of the town, several people have already tried to sell you large "diamonds" that you strongly suspect are just clear sapphires.`

planet "Bloodsea"
	attributes frontier pirate south "south pirate"
	landscape land/beach5
	description `Bloodsea is nearly uninhabited, except for a few pirate outposts. Its name comes from the planet's oceans, which are blood-red due to rhodophyte algae. Although the climate is temperate and there are many white sand beaches, no one comes here hoping to go swimming.`
	description `	The pirates have no industry of their own, but instead make a living by reselling stolen cargo from raids on merchant fleets.`
	spaceport `When you landed your ship near one of the larger outposts, no one even came out to greet you or to check your paperwork - not that anyone on a pirate world would care about such things. In the center of town is an open-air marketplace where large men armed with large guns stand guard over piles of crates, while others examine the wares that are for sale and haggle over prices.`
	spaceport `	The local slang incorporates threats of extreme violence as a seemingly meaningless verbal tic. "Hey, I'm gonna cut off your fingers one by one until you buy a meat patty!" a vendor calls out cheerfully as you pass. "First one's free, and I'll tie a knot in your spine if you don't like it."`
