	description "The Meteor Missile is the cheapest and simplest homing weapon available in human space, with only rudimentary infrared tracking systems that can have trouble homing in on targets with low heat levels. True to its name, the missile reaches a very high speed to leave its target's anti-missile defenses with little time to react. The trade-off is maneuverability, so Meteor Missiles are practically useless against agile targets farther than point-blank range."
